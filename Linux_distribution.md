+ **Linux is a kernel,different distributions are based on this kernel**

  Here are all the Linux distributions and the picture shows the detailed relationship of them.

  They are really an extremely huge clan.But the main Linux distributions can be summed up 

  as four series.

+ **Distributions of different series and their characteristics**

  Famous distributions belong to Debian series include Debian,Ubuntu,Linux Mint, and Deepin.

  And Slackware series which include Suse and Opensuse is popular for its high security.

  Red Hat series is widely used in enterprises because of its stability.It's free distribution for

  community is called CentOS.

+ **My favorite distribution of Arch series**

  The last one is Arch series,which is my favority.Arch was released in 2002 first time.Compared with other series,Arch is the youngest,but also the most free and open source.The most differece is that Arch Linux uses the rolling distribution mode to obtain the latest system updates and software versions.

+ **Now I'm using manjaro**

  And now,I use manjaro based as Arch_Linux as my daily system.Those people who use Arch 

  series like me always call themself as saints of Arch.
